The Model Management System (MMS) provide services for managing models and is a version control system for structured data. It exposes model information through RESTful web services that can be used for CRUD operations, branching, and tagging of the model repository. This heart of the MMS is the View Service which supports the transclusion features of Views.

The MMS also provides web services for storing and searching Jupyter Lab notebooks.

Those looking to use MMS as an end user or in a production environment should look into the `MMS Reference Implementation <https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mmsri>`_.
